        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a highschool senior with a large interest in computer coding, computer programming, and design. I've been self teaching myself through websites such as: codecademy, teamtreehouse, reading various HTML/CSS books, and talking to a few other front end web developers for learning sources and ideas.</p>
        <p>I have a strong drive to learn about computer coding and how I can change the world around me with it. I'm always striving to perfect any new subject I learn until I can perform it with ease. I'll never stop trying to learn new things in life, I belive it's essential in order to grow as person.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be able to build web sites from the ground up and possibly create IOS apps one day. Skills I would like to master are:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
          <li>Objective-C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ideally I would like to work with a web design company that delivers only the best product to the customer and fully satisfies their needs with a professional website.</p>
